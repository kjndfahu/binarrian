Consequently, miners prioritize transactions with higher fees. The appropriate fee for a transaction varies based on the cryptocurrency and other factors like transaction size and network conditions. Your wallet will autonomously determine the optimal fee for your chosen cryptocurrency. For instance, ether transactions have a static fee, whereas fees for bitcoin, bitcoin cash, and stellar are dynamic and computed by your wallet upon specifying the transfer amount. Further insights into bitcoin transaction fees are detailed in this article.",
